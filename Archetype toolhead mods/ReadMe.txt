Assorted mods for the Archetype toolhead

experimental dragon ace mount: moddified dragon uhf mount, replaced the 4 bladed fan mount with a 3 bladed one which matches the back of a generic 2510 fan. Had issues with original 4 blade design due to not using a delta 2510.

miniolnir: 4010 fan mount mod, more direct fan cooling in theory, blackbird 4010 was choking the exhaust for the hotend, resulting in clogs.

Shepherd: using clone bmg gears. original spacing was too large, significant filament slippage, gears are 0.4 mm closer. face plate is also slightly closer to the body.
          moddified backbrace to use heatset inserts instead of square nuts.
